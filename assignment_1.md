Assignment 1: R markdown template
================

## Instructions: Please read through this before you begin

  - This assignment is due by **10pm on Wednesday 09/23/20**.

  - For this assignment, please **reproduce this markdown file exactly
    as shown** using R markdown. You do **NOT** need to fill out the
    code chunks (i.e. answer the questions) for this assignment. We are
    just practicing markdown formatting right now.

  - Please name your R markdown file `assignment_1.Rmd` and the knitted
    markdown file `assignment_1.md`.

  - Pay attention to all the formating in this file, including bullet
    points, bolded characters, inserted code chunks, headings, text
    colors, blank lines, and etc. You will need to reproduce all of
    these.

  - You will use the product of this assignment as a template for your
    third assignment, where you will actually fill out the code chunks.

  - You will have to submit your assignment through GitHub. You can
    complete your template after Wednesday’s class (09/16/20), but don’t
    worry about submitting it until after we have gone over how to
    submit it through GitHub in Monday’s class (09/21/20). To do so, you
    will first move assignment\_1.Rmd and assignment\_1.md to the
    problem\_sets folder in your own GitHub repository that you have
    created in class through GitHub Classroom. (If you haven’t created
    this repo yet, please use the following url:
    <https://classroom.github.com/a/SA7QIA7g>). Then, you can stage
    these files, make a commit, and push the commit.

## Exercise 1. Corruption and human development

This exercise explores a dataset containing the human development index
(`HDI`) and corruption perception index (`CPI`) of 173 countries across
6 different regions around the world: Americas, Asia Pacific, Eastern
Europe and Central Asia (`East EU Cemt`), Western Europe (`EU W.
Europe`), Middle East and North Africa and Noth Africa (`MENA`), and
Sub-Saharan Africa (`SSA`). (Note: the larger `CPI` is, the less
corrupted the country is perceived to be.)

<br>

First, we load the data using the following code.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.1 Show the first few rows of `economist_data`.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.2 Expore the relationship between human development index (`HDI`) and corruption perception index (`CPI`) with a scatter plot as the following.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.3 Make the color of all points in the previous plot red.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.4 Color the points in the previous plot according to the `Region` variable, and set the size of points to 2.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.5 Set the size of the points proportional to `HDI.Rank`

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.6 Fit a **smoothing line** to **all** the data points in the scatter plot from Excercise 1.4

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.7 Fit a separate **straight line** for **each region** instead, and turn off the confidence interval.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.8 Building on top of the previous plot, show each `Region` in a different facet.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.9 Show the distribution of `HDI` in each region using density plot. Set the transparency to 0.5

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.10 Show the distribution of `HDI` in each region using histogram and facetting.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.11 Show the distribution of `HDI` in each region using a box plot. Set the transparency of these boxes to 0.5. Also show data points for each country in the same plot. (Hint: `geom_jitter()` or `position_jitter()` might be useful.)

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.12 Show the count of countries in each region using a bar plot.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 1.13 You have now created a variety of different plots of the same dataset. Which of your plots do you think are the most informative? Describe briefly the major trends that you see in the data.

## Exercise 2. Unemployment in the US 1967-2015

This excercise uses the dataset `economics` from the ggplot2 package. It
was produced from US economic time series data available from
<http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2>. It descibes the number of
unemployed persons (`unemploy`), among other variables, in the US from
1967 to 2015.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 2.1 Plot the trend in number of unemployed persons (`unemploy`) though time using the economics dataset shown above. And for this question only, **hide your code and only show the plot**.

``` r
## Write your code here
```

<br>

#### 2.2 Edit the plot title and axis labels of the previous plot appropriately. Make y axis start from 0. Change the background theme to what is shown below. (Hint: search for help online if needed)

``` r
## Write your code here
```
